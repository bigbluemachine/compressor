compressor
==========

A simple lossless compression program. I wrote this from scratch with no help of any references. Of course, this is by no means an efficient or general-purpose compressor.

To do:

- Reduce space usage of prefix-free coding algorithm
- Make command-line application
- Port to C (not C++, because I have an irrational hatred of it)
